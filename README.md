# webmap-filters
 
**script.js**

Example logic for filtering data based on select inputs. Inputs are identified by checkboxes but may be updated to alternative elements (e.g., dropdowns, slider, radio buttons)

Based on dummy data devised for testing filters, not representative of real world events or locations

**script-slider.js**

Example logic for filtering data paints based on timeslider input (currently works independently of filters in script.js).

The timeslider uses the NoUiSlider library to allow the user to drag multipleinput points (c.f., single input with HTML 'range' element) - https://refreshless.com/nouislider/
